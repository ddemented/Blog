Been a fan of open source for quite some time, and it was sad that i never tried the jekyll before. So now when i was finally free from all sem exams, assignments, mini projects, credits blah blah, tried out the new jekyll and i feel its too easy. Other than deployement, making the posts and updating the site has never been much simpler.
Deployment and editing the template takes nearly 2 hours on a windows machine(psst .. mac charging wire down i repeat man down :p).

You can see the output for yourself.
